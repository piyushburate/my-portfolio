      <p>Hello! Thanks for stopping by my personal website.</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Ryan. I&apos;ve been working in web development for over 10 years, doing
        both the coding you see on the screen (frontend) and the stuff that
        happens behind the scenes (backend). I know how to manage projects using
        methods like Waterfall and Agile. But what really gets me excited is
        making websites and apps that are easy for everyone to use and look good
        too!
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m really into JavaScript and PHP, which are languages used to build
        websites. I also know a bunch of frameworks that make building websites
        even easier, like React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, and PHP frameworks like
        Codeigniter and Laravel. I love learning about new web tools and
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my career, I&apos;ve led teams to build software for a wide range of
        companies, from large corporations to innovative startups.
      </p>
      <p>I believe that good communication is super important in any job.</p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m good at adapting to different situations, working efficiently, and
        always trying to do my best. My experience has taught me how to solve
        problems and lead teams, but I&apos;m also happy to work with others to get
        things done. I&apos;m excited about the chance to work together and make cool
        stuff!
      </p>
      <p>I&apos;m looking forward to the possibility of working with you!</p>
      <p>
        Best Regards,
        <span className="block text-4xl mt-2">Piyush</span>
